        <h2>Project Proposal - Oct. 31</h2>
        <p>This summer, the NY state senate passed a bill to fine the hosts of certain Airbnb rentals in New York City. However, the governor of NY has yet to sign the bill. We’d like to present a website showing the context surrounding this controversial issue by showing both the prevalence of Airbnb rentals as well as the state of the housing rental market. We’ll show changes over time as well as trends by neighborhood or borough. We’ll also show the effects of illegal Airbnb rentals on lost hotel tax revenue and increased prices of standard rentals.</p>
        <p>We’ll collect data from several online sources including insideairbnb.com and tomslee.net/airbnb-data. Both of these websites have scraped data from the Airbnb website directly at different time intervals. We’ll also download Zillow’s publicly available dataset of median rental prices in NYC. Finally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics provides a consumer price index, and we will incorporate their data from 2006 until now to adjust for inflation.</p>

        <h2>Project Plan - Nov. 7</h2>
        <h3>Goals and Tasks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>General goal: Explain the legal controversy and context surrounding a bill that has been passed in NYC to regulate Airbnb rentals.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Visualize Airbnb listings over time (allow users to explore several variables)</p>
                <p>We want to give the users the tools to interact with our data on Airbnb postings. To this end, we’ll create a map with a slider that allows the user to show postings from a given map. They’ll also be able to select various attributes to color the posting dots (e.g., by price, neighborhood, etc). This will allow users to understand how Airbnb has grown in NYC in the last two years and also frame our discussion of its relationships with housing prices as well as lost tax revenue.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Show relationships between Airbnb density and housing prices in NYC</p>
                <p>Over the last several years, Airbnb listings in NYC have dramatically increased. In some areas, the cost of housing has increased as well. We want to show the rise in housing prices in NYC neighborhoods over time as a function of Airbnb density. We will use a line chart with each line representing a NYC neighborhood. The x-axis would be time (monthly from 2014 until 2016), and the y-axis would represent the percent change in Zillow Rental Index (see their methodology <a href="http://www.zillow.com/research/zillow-rent-index-methodology-2393/">here</a>) from our starting date. The lines would each be colored by the density of Airbnb postings in the neighborhood (which we will determine based on the number of residential units, calculated from data provided by the PLUTO dataset from the NYC department of city planning). The user will see a general relationship between Airbnb densities and housing price increases across NYC. They’ll also be able to filter the neighborhoods and hover over lines to identify neighborhoods with high Airbnb densities and Zillow Rental Index increases. Finally, we’ll toggle between a view of general Airbnb density and illegal Airbnb density to show the user whether it is the illegal Airbnb listings in particular that are closely related to housing cost increases.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Estimate lost tax revenue</p>
                <p>Hotels in NYC must pay 3 types of hotel tax: state sales tax, city sales tax, and a base fee per room per night. Originally, Airbnb claimed that it was only a platform and, as such, individual hosts were responsible for reporting and paying tax on their Airbnb rental revenue. However, most hosts don’t report or pay those taxes. Using the nightly price for Airbnb’s over time and an estimate for how often listings are actually reserved, we can estimate the amount of tax revenue that each host would have to pay. Then, we can show how the lost tax revenue has changed over time and produce a final amount of total amount of revenue lost over the past 2 years.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Show tax deals and other conflicts between Airbnb and other cities in the USA</p>
                <p>This visualization will show context surrounding conflicts between cities and Airbnb regarding tax revenue. On a map of the United States, we’ll have markers of cities that have made deals with Airbnb as well as cities with ongoing lawsuits (e.g. San Francisco). The user will be able to hover over these cities to see details of resolutions or ongoing conflicts.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Description of Data</h3>
        <p>We have collected data from several online sources including insideairbnb.com and tomslee.net/airbnb-data. Both of these websites have scraped data from the Airbnb website directly at different time intervals. For each listing, variables include latitude and longitude, price per night, description of the space, neighborhood, borough, host information, number of rooms, etc. We have also downloaded Zillow’s publicly available dataset of median housing rental prices in NYC, which breaks data down by neighborhood. We have collected data from the NYC Department of City Planning land use and geographic data on the number of housing units per neighborhood, from which we can calculate the density of Airbnb listings. Finally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics provides a consumer price index, and we will incorporate their data from 2006 until now to adjust for inflation.</p>
        <p>We still need to collect data on tax deals Airbnb made with other cities, which we will be able to collect by researching news reports on such deals.</p>
        <p>We also need to analyze the data in two ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Estimate which listings are illegal based on number of listings per host, host location, minimum nights to book, and type of property (and other variables if needed).
            </li>
            <li>
                Estimate amount of lost tax revenue based on nightly prices and a model for how often Airbnb’s are booked (there are models for this online so we need to pick one that works).
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Presentation in Studio - Nov. 8</h2>
        <p>After presenting our project proposal in studio, we received the following feedback:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If we’re presenting this as the two sides of a debate, that should be reflected in the structure of the project, i.e. explicitly presenting the cases of both sides.
            </li>
            <li>
                We need to make sure we stay focused with our scope, and everything connects together. In order to do that, we're going to cut the visualization showing Airbnb deletions in Nov 2015, and the map of other cities. That way, we can stay focused on the newest law in NYC specifically.

        <h2>Creative Visualizations from Lecture - Nov. 10</h2>
        <p>From earlier, we decided that our stacked bar chart showing lost tax dollars each month may be too dry and difficult for users to interpret. In order to help individuals better visualize and understand the amount of tax dollars lost.</p>
        <img src="img/sketches/NYC_Tax_Dollars_Lost_BarChart.jpg" width="500"/>
        <p>One way we might orient the user to the amount of money lost may be to show how the money translates to the cost of public services offered by NYC. For example:</p>
        <img src="img/sketches/Taxes_Pictures.jpg" width="500"/>
        <p>After designing this visualization, we decided that our drawing may be somewhat misleading because Airbnb taxes clearly would be divided and spent on various budgetary expenditures in both the city and state government. Therefore, it may make more sense instead to create a bar graph representing NYC’s budget broken up into different divisions (e.g., parks and rec) and then add a bar representing the lost tax revenue from Airbnb, so that users can compare this value to the various NYC budgets.</p>

                    <li>
                        Alena figured out what the laws are and put together a plan to calculate it, and wrote code snippets to do so.

                    <li>
                        We will write an Assumptions/Estimates document to include on the website.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assumption: Supply and demand of Airbnb listings will not change based on imposition of taxes.

                        Swap out the second map for a sankey diagram showing breakdown of legal and illegal listings. Alena found a plugin that produces them. This will help readers understand what makes something illegal, and the quantity of illegal listings.

                Sankey Diagram (Alena)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The plug in is not helpful, so we decided to create the Sankey diagram from scratch. This means hard-coding more layout information than is ideal, but at least the layout will be easily interpretable by the user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Sankey diagram is now properly laid out, but the colors aren’t ideal and the labels are a mess. We need to decide how best to label it so it’s informative but also readable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Also animating it to make the decision flow clear would be great; we need to add the animations.

                Data Wrangling for our Airbnb data (to be displayed on a map) (Nicasia)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Data wrangling is now complete.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We have cleaned data for each scrape date. For data from InsideAirbnb, we have calculated projected lost tax revenue, and have also classified whether or not that posting is likely to be illegal (this process was explained in an earlier section).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For data from Tomslee, we have extrapolated legality estimates based on whether the posting occurs in other scrapings; however, we will not be calculating taxes because this would require too much guessing about missing data.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Rental Prices in different Neighborhoods Line Chart (Nicasia)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Alena previously gathered estimates for median rental prices of neighborhoods in NYC from Zillow, and then adjusted them for inflation based on the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We’d like to give users the option to color each line (representing one neighborhood) by the following: density of Airbnbs, density of illegal Airbnbs, percentage of Airbnbs that we think are illegal. For the first two options, we need a standard by which to determine density. We have decided to use (#Airbnb postings on a given date)/(# of total residential units). To that end, we acquired the PLUTO dataset from NYC’s public website regarding geographical land use, mapped each building to neighborhoods, and calculated the total number of residential units across these buildings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We now have a rudimentary line graph that is colored by percent of posts that are illegal. We will later add an option to color the lines by the other variables explained above, but unfortunately some of the calculations have produced some odd results (e.g., more postings than there are residential units in some neighborhoods). We also have a select box where the user can choose to display data only from one borough at a time.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We want to make the map more interactive, so that the user can view both the large-picture display of airbnb listings in New York as well as specifics for each neighborhood. Now the user can click to zoom in or out of a given neighborhood, and we will add coordinate views to visualize the data for each individual neighborhood.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The user can now also color the listings (nodes) on the map by legality and price (or none if they just want to see the number of listings in New York City).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We still have to add the coordinate views, and edit the map’s legend to reflect changes in node coloration.
